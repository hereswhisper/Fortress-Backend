Anker, this is a personal message to you and for your future of your things. You clearly admin abused. You banned a person, for wanting help and you banned them for "arguing". That does not and WILL NOT warrent a ban by any means. and when I attempt to ask why they got banned. you acted INSANELY hostile and banned me aswell for no fucking reason. this is your fault and you should know that actions have consequences. You blocked me on Discord so I couldn't even have the CHANCE to explain why you are acting very foolish with your behaviour. I always tell myself to always trust people until you can't. I tried that with you and you completely ruined it for me. I genuinely thought you were a cool dude and you would be really respectful. But instead of doing that you ban me for zero reason, blocked me on all social media so I can't message you to explain my reasoning on WHY they should not be banned. You did EVERYTHING in your power to not give me a platform to state my reasoning on why they should not be banned when they clearly just wanted support from you and you blew them off as if it was "their" issue and not yours when at the end of the day. It is all your fault, they had NO issue on their end and should've downloaded it fine but instead of being like hm let me figure this out, you ban them from the discord for "arguing".
