You’ll play the same track as other players but get to choose your song part and difficulty as you riff your way to the highest score. Owned Jam Tracks cannot be selected, so no one player has an advantage. The four lowest-scoring players are eliminated at the end of each song until there’s a single victor!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Festival Battle Stage\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-festival-battle-stage-1920x1080-46dc0b311856.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nDon’t worry if you hear a tune you haven’t mastered yet. You can turn the tides of battle by launching attacks on your opponents to slow their scoring and break their streak! Prepare for your attack the same way you’d launch into Overdrive on the Main Stage — play Overdrive Phases to build Overdrive and press the Attack button to throw your rivals off course while boosting your own score! The more Overdrive you hold, the longer your attack will be.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nPlaying accurately, maintaining your streak, and attacking at the right times is key. We've set the Bass and Mic multipliers to 4x instead of 6x on the Battle Stage, so everyone’s on an even playing field! The skill rating system in public matches, based on rounds survived and players defeated, is factored into matchmaking so you don't face off against the #1 player in the world right off the bat.<br />\n<br />\nIf you play Battle Stage in a private match, compete against your party of up to four! We’ll leave the setlist to you — players in a private match can choose from their shared library of owned Jam Tracks and Festival’s featured rotation.<br />\n<br />\nFind the Battle Stage in Discover next to “Festival Main Stage” and “Festival Jam Stage.” This experience will stick around beyond Season 4.

        "content": "<p>LEGO® Fortnite fans,<br />\n<br />\nMaybe you like combat, but want it to be a little easier so you can build, farm, AND feel mighty. That’s where the new <strong>Cozy</strong> mode comes in!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Cozy Mode\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-cozy-mode-1920x1080-c20797419b5f.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nPerhaps for you, Survival mode was just the start. Do you have what it takes to face fiercer foes? Think you can up your game against regular enemies? And above all, are you willing to take on these challenges with the risk of <em><strong>permanent elimination</strong></em>? Test just how unbreakable you are in LEGO Fortnite’s new <strong>Expert</strong> mode!<br />\n<br />\nPlay Cozy and Expert when v30.10 arrives June 13.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nGet Comfy in Cozy Mode</h2>\n\n<p>Whether you’re a beginner survivor or a builder who likes <em>a little bit</em> of thrill, Cozy mode’s up your alley! Create a world and get greeted by Slumber, a friendly face who’ll guide you through your journey step-by-step.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nCozy Mode Default Settings</h3>\n\n<p>Cozy mode is a nice mix of Survival and Sandbox mode. If that sounds like your thing, choose Cozy mode when creating a new world! These are the default settings if you choose Cozy mode. (They can all be changed!)</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Enemies</strong> - On</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Enemy Difficulty</strong> <em>(new setting!)</em> - Easy</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Storm-Wild Enemies</strong> <em>(new setting!)</em> - Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Hunger</strong> - Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Temperature</strong> - Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Stamina</strong> - Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Player Elimination</strong> - Respawn</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Drop Inventory Upon Elimination</strong> - Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Friendly Creatures</strong> - On</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Friendly Damage</strong> - Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Villagers</strong> - On</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Power System</strong> - Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Village Animals Removed On Elimination</strong> - Off</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nSurvive a Wild World in Expert Mode</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Expert Mode\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-expert-mode-1920x1080-7957f7bca927.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\nStorm-Wild Enemies</h3>\n\n<p>‘Fraid of Wild Wolves? Well now there are even wilder wolves.<br />\n<br />\nIn Expert mode, creatures infected by a “storm” roam with creatures who haven’t been infected. (Where did this storm come from...) These <strong>Storm-Wild</strong> enemies deal more damage, have more Health, <em>and</em> move faster than regular enemies. If you're not prepared to face them, running away won't be easy...<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Storm-Wild Enemy\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-storm-wild-enemy-1920x1080-bfc647fb292a.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>All Storm-Wild enemies:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Blaster</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Bone Wolf</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Brute</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Frost Brute</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Frost Roller</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Frost Scorpion</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Frost Wolf</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Hermit Crab</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Sand Brute</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Sand Roller</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Sand Scorpion</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Sand Spider</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Sand Wolf</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Scorpion</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Skeleton</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Scoundrels</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Spider</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Stone Roller</li>\n\t<li>Storm-Wild Wild Wolf</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nStronger Enemies</h3>\n\n<p>Regular enemies will be stronger in Expert mode than in other modes, even if they aren’t Storm-Wild! Better get those Recurve Crossbows and Longswords ready.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nPerma-limination</h3>\n\n<p>So you’re still not scared? That’s good…<br />\n<br />\nWe should warn you: losing all your hearts in a world where Expert mode is on will make you <strong>permanently eliminated</strong> from that world. Got involved in a bad situation? If you have a&nbsp;<strong>Totem of Return</strong>&nbsp;equipped when you lose all your hearts, you’ll revive in your bed with your backpack. The totem will destroy itself though — a small cost for escaping permanent elimination!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Totem of Return\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-totem-of-return-1920x1080-37c70f0b0571.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Unlock the recipe for the Totem of Return by adding a Storm Core to your inventory. Get Storm Cores from Storm-Wild enemies!</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe Totem of the Immortal will also be in Expert mode. Got eliminated with no totem in tow? On the bright side, you won’t be eliminated from <em>all</em> of LEGO Fortnite… you can still hop into non-Expert worlds or make a new Expert world! So what happens to the old one? Key holders will still have a shot at survival unless you delete it.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nTrophies for Your Bravery</h3>\n\n<p>Mark your survival skills with trophies in your world!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Expert Mode Trophies\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-expert-mode-trophies-1920x1080-87a1d584b97a.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nHere are the symbols of courage you can earn in Expert mode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Grasslands Trophy</strong>: Unlock by defeating a Storm-Wild Brute in the Grasslands, then interacting with a Level 10 Grasslands Village.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Dry Valley Trophy</strong>: Unlock by defeating a Storm-Wild Sand Brute, then interacting with a Level 10 Dry Valley Village.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Frostlands Trophy</strong>: Unlock by defeating a Storm-Wild Frost Brute, then interacting with a Level 10 Frostlands Village.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />\nIf you earn these trophies, you’ve truly <em>earned</em> them 🏆</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nExpert Mode Default Settings</h3>\n\n<p>Choose Expert mode when creating a new world! When creating a world, these are the default settings if you select Expert:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Enemies</strong> - On (cannot be changed!)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Enemy Difficulty</strong> <em>(new setting!)</em> - Hard (cannot be changed!)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Storm-Wild Enemies</strong> <em>(new setting!)</em> - On (cannot be changed!)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Hunger</strong> - On (cannot be changed!)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Temperature</strong> - On (cannot be changed!)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Stamina</strong> - On (cannot be changed!)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Player Elimination</strong> - Permanent (cannot be changed!)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Drop Inventory Upon Elimination</strong> - On (cannot be changed!)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Friendly Creatures</strong> - On (cannot be changed… we’re throwing you a bone)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Friendly Damage</strong> - Off (this can be changed if you wanna go the extra mile)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Villagers</strong> - On (cannot be changed… you’ll need these buddies to help you out!)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Power System</strong> - On (cannot be changed… you’ll have to put in the work!)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Village Animals Removed On Elimination</strong> - On (cannot be changed… keep ‘em safe!)</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nMajor Improvements, Adjustments, and Bug Fixes</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nLow Memory vs. Too Many Constructs Nearby</h3>\n\n<p>Before v30.10, you may have seen a <strong>“high complexity”</strong> warning in your world, limiting your ability to build. v30.10 will clarify whether this is because of <strong>low memory</strong> or <strong>too many constructs nearby</strong>.<br />\n<br />\nIf you get a <strong>low memory</strong> or <strong>too many constructs nearby</strong> notification, here’s how you can try continuing normal play:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Low Memory</strong>: Try reducing overall constructs, the number of unique constructs, or items and creatures. Moving away from dense areas or exiting and re-entering the world can help too. (Note: the amount of memory available depends on the platform you’re playing on.)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Too Many Constructs Nearby</strong>: Try spreading out constructs over larger areas. Also try using larger Building Parts rather than many smaller ones to achieve a similar result. Building in a different location or removing constructs&nbsp;you no longer want can also help.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nMore Things</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Villagers in the Rebel Village will no longer count towards the world Villager cap.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The world Villager count in the Village Hub will display&nbsp;the correct number of Villagers.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Skeletons will be less likely to spawn in&nbsp;Villages.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Lava Caves&nbsp;on Star Wars Island will have Rubies!</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Animals will do a better job avoiding Campfires.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Wolves learned how to swim!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nLEGO Styles? We Got ‘Em!</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Lars LEGO Style\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-lars-lego-style-1920x1080-fe84b0ac4c34.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nSpeaking of difficulty, choosing your perfect LEGO look for every occasion isn’t always easy.
